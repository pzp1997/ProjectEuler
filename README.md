# Project Euler

Some of my solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) problems. I am trying to attempt most of the problems in multiple languages just for kicks.

Below you can find a table with the problems I have solved (and the languages I have solved them in).

|   |  Python  |   OCaml  |   Java   |
